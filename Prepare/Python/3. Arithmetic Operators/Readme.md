# Arithmetic Operators

The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, `a` and `b`. Add code to
print three lines where:

1. The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
2. The second line contains the difference of the two numbers
   ($first - second$).
3. The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

## Example

- $a=3$
- $b=5$

Print the following:

```python
8
-2
15
```

## Input Format

- The first line contains the first integer `a`.
- The second line contains the second integer `b`.

## Constraints

- $1 \leq a \leq 10^{10}$
- $1 \leq b \leq 10^{10}$

## Output Format

Print the three lines as explained above.
